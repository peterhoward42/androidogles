Android GL Play Around
----------------------

*  Get tutorial to work
*  Start afresh with copy to mess with keeping old as reference
*  Timeout for a second pass of studies
*  Get into github
*  Study and note git from first principles to be confident with branch usage
*  Tag the current commit as the official baseline
*  Make roadmap of ideas
*  Shaders from assets, retest, and commit
*  Dependency inject data for > 1 co-planar triangle
*  Have the camera transform change with time and add triangles out of plane
*  Have different bits of the model use different location transforms
*  Digress redesign for lighting
*  Timeout strip all debug out
*  Create bit of package hierachy
*  Try a STL file source
*  Combine modelcollection with assembler into dynamic scene
o  Add binary stl dynamicscene
o  More complex model
    o  Work up to animated worm and wheel
        *  Make resource files
        *  Binary reader and unit test
        *  Need to close stream? (no client must)
        *  improve class names
        *  time based sinusoid fails to use pi in calcs
        o  design aspirational model / assr for worm and wheel
        o  do it
        o  try it
o  Ditch blade stl for ip sake

STL binary format

STL scene assembly model

o  What is the uxp
    o  Static oblique viewpoint
    o  Gear teeth mesh properly
    o  Animated sync slow model
o  What therefore are the demands of the interfaces?
    o  ModelCollection
        o  Get mesh by name
        o  Query num triangles by name per mesh
    o  
o  How do it?
