Android GL Play Around
----------------------

*  Get tutorial to work
*  Start afresh with copy to mess with keeping old as reference
*  Timeout for a second pass of studies
*  Get into github
*  Study and note git from first principles to be confident with branch usage
*  Tag the current commit as the official baseline
*  Make roadmap of ideas
*  Shaders from assets, retest, and commit
*  Dependency inject data for > 1 co-planar triangle
*  Have the camera transform change with time and add triangles out of plane
*  Have different bits of the model use different location transforms
o  Digress redisgn for lighting
    *  Decide input data structure for scene model - leave as is
    *  Convert back to drawArrays() with flat shading
    *  Do security check in
    *  Fix bug where not all faces shown
    *  Add in calculated face normals to triangle objects
        o  Convey face normals into vertex shader
            *  First stop posn handle from being field and check
            *  Re-read book on xtra vertex attribs and impact on
               call to drawarrays and impact on vertex shader
            *  Pack normal as part of vertex
            o  Attempt to get normals passed into vertex shader
                *  Code and compile
                o  Regression run
                    o  Crashes
                        o  Cannot get slot for vNormal
                            o  Add errors to load shader code
                                o  doesn't seem to be firing?
                            o  Add error to link phase
                            o  Try putting handles back as fields
                o  How assess if arrived?
    o  Do and debug lighting calcs in vertex shader but don't use
    o  Pass calced light into fragment as varying and use it
o  Try a cad generated source
