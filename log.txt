Android GL Play Around
----------------------

*  Get tutorial to work
*  Start afresh with copy to mess with keeping old as reference
*  Timeout for a second pass of studies
*  Get into github
*  Study and note git from first principles to be confident with branch usage
*  Tag the current commit as the official baseline
*  Make roadmap of ideas
*  Shaders from assets, retest, and commit
*  Dependency inject data for > 1 co-planar triangle
*  Have the camera transform change with time and add triangles out of plane
o  Have different bits of the model use different location transforms
    *  Design
    *  Time out to have some primitive builders
    *  Ensure uniqueing of vertices is working
    *  Update existing scene interface to do compartmentalise as per
    *  Time out to clean up contractual coupling between cam posn, cam and
       clip planes
    *  Ditch interfaces for now
    *  Conv scene to properly scene object silos
    *  Introduce scene director
    *  Divvy up respon in workflow
    *  App for now can be in charge of cam
    *  Shorten triangleworldmodel
    *  High level renderer responsib for telling tri to draw, but must pass
       thru transform to convert scene object coll to moved and cammed coords
    *  Get transforms from silo lookup
    *  Debug
    *  Lesson learned make combiner object
    *  Add second silo that offsets aux cube
    *  do differential transforming animation to show clearly
    o  git checkin incl roadmap, tag and push

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduce compartmentalised scene model with named silos, and have a new scene
direction object, provide model to world transforms separately for each silo.
Have the triangles renderer consume this compartmentalised model and apply the
transforms on a per silo basis in the draw method. Animate these transforms 
as a function of time.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compartmentalise the scene into named silos.
