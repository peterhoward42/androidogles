Android GL Play Around
----------------------

*  Get tutorial to work
*  Start afresh with copy to mess with keeping old as reference
*  Timeout for a second pass of studies
*  Get into github
*  Study and note git from first principles to be confident with branch usage
*  Tag the current commit as the official baseline
*  Make roadmap of ideas
*  Shaders from assets, retest, and commit
*  Dependency inject data for > 1 co-planar triangle
*  Have the camera transform change with time and add triangles out of plane
*  Have different bits of the model use different location transforms
*  Digress redesign for lighting
*  Timeout strip all debug out
*  Create bit of package hierachy
*  Try a STL file source
*  Combine modelcollection with assembler into dynamic scene
*  Ditch num tri qry on dynamic scene - is duplicate of mesh api
*  Change name of qry on mesh from size to numberOfTriangles
*  Can we rename effective radius to make it clearer
*  Ditch blade stl for ip sake
o  More complex model
    o  Work up to animated worm and wheel
        *  Make resource files
        *  Binary reader and unit test
        *  Need to close stream? (no client must)
        *  improve class names
        *  time based sinusoid fails to use pi in calcs
        *  design aspirational model / assr for worm and wheel
        *  do it
            *  Create specialised dynamic scene and select it in activity
            *  Have it read and store stl meshes
            *  Write the whole thing with loads assumptions
            *  Implement and test BoundingBox factory from min max
            *  Implement and test TransformApply.boundingBox
            *  Implement and test BoundingBox.combine()
        *  Quick app test - just see what happens
            *  Something shows
            *  STL bin reader needs unit test to regression the 2 byte short
               read
        *  Move bb into incremental api and give mesh one
        *  Fix up wheel geom etc by disabling and reenabling gradually
            *  Wheel seems transparent, have I got Z depth buffering enabled?
            *  Fix camera temporarily
            *  Make sure move to world centre as v first thing, before
               doing any rotations, and then translate again
               afterwards.
            *  Animate wheel
        *  Fix up worm geom similarly
            *  Basics work
    o  Improve projection
    o  When project nice, tweak animation and position params
