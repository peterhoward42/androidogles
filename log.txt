Android GL Play Around
----------------------

*  Get tutorial to work
*  Start afresh with copy to mess with keeping old as reference
*  Timeout for a second pass of studies
*  Get into github
*  Study and note git from first principles to be confident with branch usage
*  Tag the current commit as the official baseline
*  Make roadmap of ideas
*  Shaders from assets, retest, and commit
*  Dependency inject data for > 1 co-planar triangle
*  Have the camera transform change with time and add triangles out of plane
*  Have different bits of the model use different location transforms
*  Digress redesign for lighting
*  Timeout strip all debug out
o  Create bit of package hierachy
o  Try a STL file source
    o  Consider how best keep existing code alive including
       silo specific animation and at least hooks for camera animation
        o  Should SceneDirector and SceneObjects be named differently?
        o  Scene Objects
            o  Convert to interface, consider name carefully is it just
               scene model contents?
        o  Scene Director
            o  Convert to interface
        o  Projection
            o  Call to build silo rendering matrices in myglrenderer should
               delegate out to specialised class, with DI tbd
        o  Camera
            o  Feed into the above
        o  Light position ditto
        o  Utility to make collection of triangles from .stl
            o  Maybe including correction of winding order
