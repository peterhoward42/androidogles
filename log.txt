Android GL Play Around
----------------------

*  Get tutorial to work
*  Start afresh with copy to mess with keeping old as reference
*  Timeout for a second pass of studies
*  Get into github
*  Study and note git from first principles to be confident with branch usage
*  Tag the current commit as the official baseline
*  Make roadmap of ideas
*  Shaders from assets, retest, and commit
*  Dependency inject data for > 1 co-planar triangle
o  Have the camera transform change with time and add triangles out of plane
    *  Restudy transform use incl viewport
        *  annotate code with new understanding
        *  remind from prev generic ogles notes
    *  Test veracity of variables called top left etc in this context
    *  Decide how will change with time uxp wise
    *  Design maths
    *  Verify maths with debug
    *  Apply transform
    *  Why does moving near clip plane make the graphics smaller?
        *  Because the frustumM transform includes implicit perspective.
    *  Draw some reassuring diagrams
    *  Work thru all geom again with static content
    *  Change to leave scene static and set camera
    *  Add some triangles out of plane 
    *  Try oblique cam pos
    *  Add anim
    *  Clean up
    o  Check in
    o  Tagpush
