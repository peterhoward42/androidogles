Roadmap for Open GL Experiments
-------------------------------

*  Get shaders from assets
*  Convert to using uniqued vertices list with sequence list
*  Dependency inject data for > 1 co-planar triangle
*  Isolate renderer
*  Use a static camera transform
*  Have the camera transform change with time and add triangles out of plane
*  Upgrade the projection transform to have perspective
*  Have different bits of the model use different location transforms
*  Make just some parts of the model move
*  Have prim adding library to build model
*  Have some color variation
*  Add some lighting
o  Investigate performance limits for frame rate and busting memory
