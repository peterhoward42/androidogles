Roadmap for Open GL Experiments
-------------------------------

*  Get shaders from assets
*  Convert to using uniqued vertices list with sequence list
o  Dependency inject data for > 1 co-planar triangle
o  Isolate renderer
o  Use a static camera transform
o  Have the camera transform change with time
o  Have different bits of the model use different location transforms
o  Have some color variation
o  Add some lighting
o  Have prim adding library to build model
o  Deploy more than one program to render scene
o  Investigate performance limits for frame rate and busting memory
